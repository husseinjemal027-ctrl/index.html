# Copilot Instructions for This Codebase

## Overview
This project is a collection of simple HTML and CSS tutorial files. It demonstrates basic web layout, inline styles, and table formatting. There is no build system, external dependencies, or advanced architecture—just static HTML and CSS for educational purposes.

## File Structure
- `hu.html`: Demonstrates a styled `<div>` with a border and background color.
- `inline.html`: Shows three side-by-side `<div>`s using inline styles and the `float` property.
- `table.html`: Contains a styled HTML table with custom borders and background color.
- `hu/`: Currently empty, reserved for future content or organization.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- All files use direct HTML and CSS—no JavaScript or frameworks.
- CSS is written either in `<style>` tags in the `<head>` or as inline `style` attributes.
- Layout is achieved using classic CSS properties like `float` and `width`.
- Table styling uses `border`, `border-collapse`, and `background-color`.
- Some files contain minor syntax errors (e.g., typos in tag names or CSS properties). These are likely unintentional and should be fixed if editing.

## Developer Workflow
- No build or test steps are required. Simply open `.html` files in a browser to view.
- To add new examples, create additional `.html` files following the existing style.
- If you add CSS or HTML, keep it simple and readable for beginners.

## Examples
- To add a new colored section, copy a `<div>` from `inline.html` and adjust the `background-color`.
- To add a new table row, copy a `<tr>` block from `table.html` and update the cell values.

## Project-Specific Notes
- This project is intended for learning and demonstration. Prioritize clarity and simplicity over advanced features.
- If you find broken HTML or CSS, correct it to ensure examples render properly in browsers.
